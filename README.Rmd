# teamstrength

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The teamstrength will generate difference form indicators for comparing home and away fixed effects.
The indicators are setup so that a single team fixed effect will be fitted for both home and away
games. This allows a single metric to be developed to measure a team's performance, and also allows 
the analysis of home field advantage.

## Installation

You can install the released version of teamstrength from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("justinehrlich/teamstrength")
```
