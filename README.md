# teamstrength

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The teamstrength will generate difference form indicators for comparing
home and away fixed effects. The indicators are setup so that a single
team fixed effect will be fitted for both home and away games. This
allows a single metric to be developed to measure a team’s performance,
and also allows the analysis of home field advantage.

## Installation

You can install the released version of teamstrength from my github page
with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("justinehrlich/teamstrength")
