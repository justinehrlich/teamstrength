# teamstrength

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The teamstrength package will generate Nettleton’s (2019) difference
form indicators for comparing home and away fixed effects. The
indicators are setup so that a single team fixed effect will be fitted
for both home and away games. This allows a single metric to be
developed to measure a team’s performance, and also allows the analysis
of home field advantage.

## Installation

You can install the released version of teamstrength from my github page
with:

``` r
